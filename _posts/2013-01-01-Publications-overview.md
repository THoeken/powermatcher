## Early Articles ##
In the early days of the PowerMatcher development, a seminal article has been presented at the AAMAS 2005 Conference. This article won an industry award and was part of an overview article in IEEE Intellgent Systems. The original AAMAS paper is still the best-cited paper on the PowerMatcher.
