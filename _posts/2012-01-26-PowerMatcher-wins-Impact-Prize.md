Both projects are sustainable electricity demonstration projects: the EcoGrid prototype of the European smart electricity grid and PowerMatching City, the first living smart grid community in the world. This has been announced at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro.

The PowerMatcher, and its application in the EcoGrid large-scale smart grid demonstration, won the TNO Energy Impact Prize 2011 last Tuesday. Out of a list of around 20 projects and technologies, PowerMatcher was selected as one of 4 nominees.
