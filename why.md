## The current situation in electrical networks ##

In a world increasingly concerned about the cost, availability and environmental consequences of conventional energy supplies, the electrical power industry stands on the cusp of a profound transition. Presently, the power industry has to cope with a growing electricity demand using an ageing electricity infrastructure. This in parallel with the transition towards generation through intermittent and decentralized sources of clean(er) energy poses landmark challenges for the sector. Consumers are becoming “Prosumers”, by using energy from the grid at one time, while feeding in at another. Further, the supply-side controllability decreases since part of the installed capacity is intermittent and dependent on external conditions such as weather (wind, sun) or local heat demand (cogeneration).
If energy supply and demand responded to real time and varying energy prices, a huge potential for controllability gains on the demand side would be generated. For instance, charging of the batteries of electric or plug in hybrid vehicles would create a price sensitive outlet for off peak demand. To address these challenges in a cost-effective manner, the Smart Grid requires a scaleable two-way coordination mechanism that is able to communicate and optimize over a multitude of small to medium-sized controllable generators and loads, with the Smart Meter acting as the key enabler.



## The missing link ##
The missing link is a communication and coordination protocol for Smart Grids, as part of a complete system architecture. An electricity network is needed that responds dynamically to the permanently changing supply and demand situations through real time market based solutions that automate control operations. Energy companies, consumers and regulators alike are seeking a vision for the grid, that extends the accommodation capabilities for increasing renewable energy generation. The envisaged system incorporates advanced grid technologies which enable complete grid communication and coordination from the consumer up all the way up to the network operator and the wholesale markets.

## PowerMatcher Business Cases ##
Business cases for the PowerMatcher can be found in electricity trading, active distribution management and in energy management in homes and buildings.

Examples of business areas which could benefit from PowerMatcher are the following:

### Flexibility service providers (FSP) ###
The FSP aggregates flexibility from individual households and/or businesses and offers it to flexibility consumers. 

### Community service providers (CSP) ###
The CSP aggregates flexibility from a group of households (e.g. a community) and offers it to flexibility consumers.

### Energy service companies (ESCO) ###
ESCO's use the flexibility of individual businesses in order to reduce the connection capacity.

### Domotics / Intelligent Homes ###
Use the flexibility available at individual households such that locally generated electricity is used on the spot as much as possible.

## Need for flexibility
In the Netherlands, the following parties benefit from flexibility:

### Balance response party (BRP)

### Grid operator (TSO and DSO)

### Individual end user  

### Flexibility providers

 
#Business Cases in Electricity Trading
With the PowerMatcher technology virtual power plants can be created, clustering numerous distributed generators, responsive loads and electricity storages in a single operational unit. Such a virtual plant is able to provide flexibility services for the balancing markets.
In a field test involving industrial & residential generation and demand response the PowerMatcher was used to balance wind energy production. The system achieved an imbalance reduction of 40 – 45%.
In the Dutch balancing market, a 100MW wind farm has approx. 1 Mio euros imbalance costs on an annual turn over of approx. 10 Mio euros.
 
#Business Cases in Active Distribution Management
In distribution system operations, PowerMatcher business cases can be found in network congestion management, network load profile shaping and black-start support, for instance
In a field test involving 10 micro-CHP systems at the premises of end-customer’s premises, PowerMatcher showed capable of reducing the peak load at the MV/LV transformer with 30% to 50%.
