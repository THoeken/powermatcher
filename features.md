## A quick overview of the PowerMatcher technology ##
The PowerMatcher is an open source information and communications technology (ICT) for coordination in a smart electricity grid. It is capable of optimizing over high numbers of small units: distributed generators, responsive demand and electricity storage. The PowerMatcher is designed for scalability: in future power systems high numbers of smaller units, typically 100W to 5MW, will be involved in coordination tasks.

## key Features ##
The PowerMatcher can be used for:
 - Peakshaving
 - Balancing energy production and demand
 
## The PowerMatcher approach ##


## Current implementations ##
Current PowerMatcher implementations can be found on the [Flexiblepower Alliance Network
